# HackRice 12 First Timers Track - Life Hacks Android App

## Track Description
People have a million things going on at once, and it is just so hard to balance everything. That is where we introduce life hacks—they make your life easier! Since we spend a solid chunk of our day using our phones, we’ve made utility apps to save us time and energy, in turn allowing us to be more efficient every day. We want you to do the same!


## Prompt
There are a lot of tasks that could be eased with the help of technology. Create an Android app that makes people's lives even a little bit easier.
NOTE: The entire team must be first time hackathon participants in order to compete in this track. Also, you can either build the Android app from scratch or start from our provided code in this GitHub repository which can be opened in Android Studio.
