### What is it?
DayRater is a portable journaling and tracking app that allows users to record all of their thoughts and journaling in one place. We know how important mental health has become in the recent years and that people have found refuge in logging their lives. Yet the physical options always have the risk of being lost or left behind. Therefore, we have put all of the features people love, except on their phone, the one thing people NEVER leave.
